Multithreading is a programming concept where multiple threads of execution run concurrently 
within a single process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control, allowing multiple 
tasks to be performed simultaneously. Multithreading is commonly used in Python to achieve concurrency, 
enabling programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently and utilize the available CPU resources 
more efficiently.

Key Concepts:
Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. 
Threads share the same memory space and resources of the process they belong to.

Concurrency: Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time. 
In a multithreaded program, multiple threads execute simultaneously, allowing tasks to overlap in time.

Parallelism: Parallelism refers to the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple CPU cores. 
While multithreading enables concurrency, it doesn't necessarily achieve parallelism unless 
executed on a multi-core processor.



Benefits of Multithreading in Python:
Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows programs to remain responsive even when 
performing CPU-intensive tasks or I/O-bound operations.

Utilization of CPU Cores: Multithreading enables efficient utilization of multiple CPU cores, 
leading to better performance in multi-core systems.

Asynchronous I/O: Threads can be used to perform asynchronous I/O operations, 
allowing programs to handle multiple I/O operations concurrently without blocking.

Considerations and Challenges:
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In CPython (the default Python interpreter), 
the GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously. 
This can limit the performance benefits of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks.

Thread Safety: Care must be taken to ensure thread safety when sharing resources 
(such as variables, data structures, or files) between multiple threads to avoid race 
conditions and data corruption.

Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity, including potential synchronization issues, 
deadlock, and overhead associated with context switching between threads.


Why Use Threads :

Thread plays a significant role in application programming. 
All the GUI programs and web servers are threaded together. 
The main reasons for using threads are:

Parallel Computation: If any user has a multiprocessor machine, then the thread can allow doing 
parallel processing with the goal of an increase in processing speed.
Standardization: It became a standard approach for all programming languages as it increases 
programming speed.
Parallel I/O (Input/Output): When we talk about the speed of input & output, 
it is comparatively slow in CPU. By placing each i/o operations in multiple individual threads, 
programmers can make use of operations done in parallel with each other & with the computation speed.
Asynchronous Events: Multiple threaded applications can deal with asynchronous actions. 
For example, in a program, programmers may not know whether the next action will be to use the 
mouse or to use the keyboard. By planting a separate thread for each action, i.e.,
two threads both for mouse and keyboard, programmers are able to code a cleaner, efficient application,
 which is to use non-blocking I/O operations.



When to use Multithreading in Python?
It is an exceptionally valuable strategy for efficient and working on the presentation of an application. 
Programmers can run multiple subtasks of an application at the same time by using multithreading. 
It lets threads talk to the same processor and share resources like files, data, and memory. 
In addition, it makes it easier for the user to continue running a program even when a portion 
of it is blocked or too long.
