1. Using the threading Module:
The threading module is a built-in module in Python that provides a high-level interface 
for working with threads.


Thread modules
It is started with Python 3, designated as obsolete, and can only be accessed with _thread that supports
backward compatibility. To implement the thread module in Python, we need to import a thread module and 
then define a function that performs some action by setting the target with a variable.

Difference between "thread" and "threading" module :
the thread module provides a basic interface for working with threads, while the threading 
module offers higher-level abstractions and synchronization mechanisms for building concurrent 
and parallel applications more easily. In most cases, it's recommended to use the threading module 
for its richer feature set and better portability, unless you have specific requirements that 
necessitate the use of the lower-level thread module.


Level of Abstraction:

thread: The thread module provides a lower-level interface for working with threads. 
It exposes functions like start_new_thread() for creating and managing threads directly.
    
threading: The threading module provides a higher-level interface and more powerful 
abstractions for working with threads. It includes classes like Thread, Lock, Semaphore, Event, etc., 
which encapsulate common threading patterns and provide synchronization mechanisms.


Synchronization:
thread: The thread module lacks built-in synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, 
and condition variables.

threading: The threading module provides various synchronization primitives like Lock, RLock, 
Semaphore, Event, and Condition for coordinating access to shared resources and managing thread execution.

Exceptions:
thread: The thread module doesn't provide built-in support for exception handling in threads. 
Any exceptions raised in a thread need to be caught manually within the thread's target function.
threading: The threading module allows exceptions raised in threads to propagate to the parent thread, 
making it easier to handle and debug errors in multi-threaded programs.


Portability:
thread: The thread module is more low-level and platform-specific, and its behavior may vary across 
different Python implementations (e.g., CPython, Jython, IronPython).

threading: The threading module is more high-level and portable, 
and its API is consistent across different Python implementations.


Concurrency Models:
thread: The thread module primarily supports threading based on the preemptive multitasking model, 
where the operating system scheduler switches between threads.

threading: The threading module supports both preemptive and cooperative multitasking models. 
It also provides facilities for asynchronous programming with coroutines.



3. Using the concurrent.futures Module:
The concurrent.futures module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously 
executing callables. It includes the ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor classes 
for thread and process-based parallelism, respectively.


4. Using the multiprocessing Module:
Although primarily used for multiprocessing, the multiprocessing module also provides a Process 
class that can be used to create and start new threads.


5. Using the asyncio Module (for Asynchronous Programming):
The asyncio module provides support for asynchronous programming in Python using coroutines. 
It includes utilities for creating and managing concurrent tasks, including tasks that run in 
separate threads.
