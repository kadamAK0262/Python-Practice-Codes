The asyncio module in Python provides a framework for asynchronous programming, 
allowing you to write concurrent code that is non-blocking and highly efficient. 
Asynchronous programming is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as network communication, 
file I/O, and database access, where the program spends a significant amount of time waiting 
for external operations to complete. Instead of waiting idly during these operations, 
asyncio enables your program to perform other tasks in the meantime, maximizing CPU utilization and 
improving overall performance.


Here's how asyncio works and why it's needed:

Event Loop: At the heart of asyncio is the event loop, which is a central mechanism for 
coordinating asynchronous operations. The event loop runs continuously, handling events and 
executing tasks as they become ready. It efficiently manages the execution of coroutines, 
which are special functions that can pause and resume their execution asynchronously.

Coroutines: Coroutines are functions that can be paused and resumed asynchronously. 
They are defined using the async def syntax and can be suspended using the await keyword. 
Coroutines allow you to write non-blocking code that can perform I/O operations without blocking 
the event loop. As a result, multiple coroutines can run concurrently within a single event loop.

Concurrency: asyncio enables concurrency by allowing multiple coroutines to run concurrently 
within the same event loop. While one coroutine is waiting for an I/O operation to complete, 
the event loop can switch to another coroutine that is ready to run, maximizing CPU utilization and 
overall throughput.

Asynchronous I/O: asyncio provides asynchronous versions of I/O operations, such as reading from sockets, 
writing to files, and making HTTP requests. These operations are non-blocking and can be performed 
concurrently with other tasks, allowing your program to handle multiple I/O operations efficiently.

Parallelism: Although asyncio does not provide true parallelism 
(i.e., executing multiple tasks simultaneously across multiple CPU cores), it can still achieve high 
concurrency and throughput by efficiently interleaving the execution of coroutines within a 
single-threaded event loop. For CPU-bound tasks that require parallelism, asyncio can be combined 
with other techniques, such as multiprocessing or threading.
